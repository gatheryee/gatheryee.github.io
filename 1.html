        <h2>About this blog</h2>
        
        <p>Welcome! This is the first post of this blog and it intends to serve the purpose of introducing and explaining the purpose of this brand new website.</p>
        
        <h3>A little about myself</h3>
        
        <p>Hello, my name is Louis and I am from Hong Kong. I am currently a university student majoring in Law and I love playing Magic the Gathering in my free time. In terms of Magic-related accomplishments, I really haven’t got any. I am probably one of the better players are my LGS where I 3-0 FNM drafts at a fairly regular rate. But on the competitive level, I haven’t even reach day 2 of a GP yet. My closest to ever doing so was when I finished 5-4 in GP Beijing 2017 and GP Kyoto 2017. On both occasions, I lost the “win-and-in” round 9. So my biggest accomplishment so far is only a top 8 finish in a PTQ.</p>
        
        <h3>The reason for starting this blog</h3>
        
        <p>The reason for starting this blog is simple. I found that I consume a lot of Magic-related content on a daily basis and I started to feel that there isn’t enough of such content to satisfy my desire. The solution I came up with is to become a content creator myself. In fact, I have always had many views and opinions on Magic-related matters which I wanted to share and this blog can now serve as a platform for me to do so.</p>
        
        <h3>The aim of this blog</h3>
        
        <p>As mentioned above, I am not a very competitive player in terms of skill and achievements to date. As a result, I do not consider myself qualified to write posts on strategy and tactics. Instead, this blog will focus on discussing and examining controversial or otherwise interesting Magic-related issues/news.</p>
