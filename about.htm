<p>Welcome to this website which has two aims. Firstly, it serves as a place for me to have fun and share my streams, videos, articles etc. The other aim is to help relatively new players to get better at Magic. I consider myself a competitive player but I am by no means a pro. If you already a competitive player looking to improve your game, you should look for guidance from fulltime professional players. The target audience of this website are relatively new players who may not, at this stage of their game, be able to understand overly advance strategy contained in videos/articles made/written by the pros. I feel that I am able to share some tips that are applicable only to new players which will help them improve as quickly as possible.</p>
